# Task2-Vehicle-Price-Prediction
In this task, a dataset is given regarding details of cars and you have to predict the selling price by using a suitable model.
We have implemented the solution using Multiple Linear Regression in Jupyter Notebook via the scikit library.

## Encoding of Categorical Variables
Since the implementation is done via regression, I have encoded the categorical variables into  numerals. I have done this via OneHotEncoder in scikit, feel free to use encoders of your choice.
